##### Why We Started This

The idea is to find like minded individuals also studying the same certification you are, and all contribute to a shared repository of notes. After 2 months of studying for Linux+, I have many formatted notes which I host publicly on my website. While studying with a group on Discord, we have discussed the idea of hosting these on a public URL using Github Pages to host and MKdocs (Markdown Documentation) as a static site generator (SSG). The project is now public on Github and anyone who has written notes of a particular exam objective/section can create a pull request for there markdown file. Or if someone is studying and they see an error, they can request a change. Overall, this allows people to utilize others resources to study for free as well as collaborate with others to maintain motivation.

##### Who is This For 

Whether you are studying for CompTIA's Linux+ Exam, a class in college, or learning for work, you've come to the right place. These notes will follow the structure of the Linux+ Exam objectives but will be useful for anyone.
