### Why We Started This
The idea is to find like minded individuals also studying the same certification you are, and all contribute to a shared repository of notes. After 2 months of studying for Linux+, I have many formatted notes which I host publicly on my [website](https://joebulfer.com/Linux/Linux%2B/1.+0+System+Management/1.1+Linux+Fundumentals). While studying with a group on Discord, we have discussed the idea of hosting these on a public URL using Github Pages to host and MKdocs (Markdown Documentation) as a static site generator (SSG). The project is now public on [Github](https://github.com/Joe-Bulfer/Linux-Study-Notes) and anyone who has written notes of a particular exam objective/section can create a pull request for there markdown file. Or if someone is studying and they see an error, they can request a change. Overall, this allows people to utilize others resources to study for free as well as collaborate with others to maintain motivation.
