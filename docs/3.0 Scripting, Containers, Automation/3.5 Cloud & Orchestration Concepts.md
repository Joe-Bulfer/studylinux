##### Kubernetes vs Docker Compose
Docker compose is mainly for managing multi container applications on a single-host deployment, and lack the scalability features of kubernetes


##### Cloud Init
Set of scripts and utilities used for configuring and customizing virtual machines when they first boot in a cloud environment, such as AWS and Azure. When the VMs boot, you can automatically configure the host name, install packages, add users and groups, configure SSH keys, really anything you want. This makes it easy to spin up VMs that are already configure how you want them. Cloud-init usually only runs on the first boot of a VM unless manually configured otherwise.

Everything can be found in `/etc/cloud`. 
```
‚ùØ ls /etc/cloud
clean.d  cloud.cfg  cloud.cfg.d  cloud-init.disabled  ds-identify.cfg  templates
```
Five stages of Cloud-Init
1. Generator (determines if )
2. Local
3. Network
4. Config
5. Final
