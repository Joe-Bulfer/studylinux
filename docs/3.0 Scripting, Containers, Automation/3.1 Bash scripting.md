##### Brace Expansion
```bash
❯ echo {1..5}
1 2 3 4 5
❯ echo {0..20..2}
0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20
❯ echo {a..f}
a b c d e f

❯ touch file{1..4}.txt
❯ ls
file1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt  file4.txt 

❯ cp -p file.config{,.bak}
❯ ls
file.config  file.config.bak

❯ echo {contents,paper,bilbiography}.md
contents.md  paper.md  bilbiography.md

❯ wget https://www.some-url.com/picture{1..8}.jpg
```
##### Command Substitution
Capture the output of a command, and store it in a variable.

```bash
var=$(command)
```
or
```bash
var=`command`
```

```bash
my_date=`date +%m-%d-%Y`
#OR
my_date=$(date +%m-%d-%Y)
echo "You accessed this date on $my_date"
```
Output
```
You accessed this date on 09-13-2023
```

##### Globbing
Globbing in Bash refers to how the shell interprets special characters such as `*`, and `?` which are commonly used to match filenames. Bash itself cannot recognize regular expressions, instead we use tools like `sed` and `awk`. It is important to distinguish globbing and regex as they can be easily confused.

The question mark matches any single character while the asterisks matches zero or more characters.
```bash
❯ ls file?.txt
file1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt file4.txt file5.txt

❯ ls file[1-3].txt
file1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt

❯ ls *.txt
dep.txt  file1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt  file4.txt file5.txt   marks.txt

❯ ls file?+(.png|.txt)
file1.png  file1.txt  file2.png  file2.txt  file3.png  file3.txt  file4.png  file5.png
```

##### Here Documents
Send multiple lines of text to a command or shell script.
```
command << [marker]
input
[marker]
```

```
❯ sort << END
∙ 3
∙ 2
∙ 4
∙ 1
∙ END
1
2
3
4
```
##### Here String
Send one line of text to a command or shell script.
```
❯ wc -c <<< "String with many characters"
28

❯ foo="bar"
❯ sed 's/a/A/' <<< "$foo"
 bAr
```


##### Shell control and redirection
`>&`, `&>`, `>>&` and `&>>` : (read above also) Redirect both standard error and standard output, replacing or appending, respectively.
##### Additional
`source` reads and executes the contents of a file as sets of commands in the **current shell**.

Here is a file called commands.txt
```
echo "Your current directory is `pwd`"
echo "The date is `date +%m-%d`"
```

```
❯ source commands.txt
Your current directory is /home/promptier/Desktop/bash
The date is 11-20
```

Note `source script` is equivalent to `. script`, not to be confused with `./script`, which runs the script as an executable file, launching a **new shell** to run it.

The `type` command is useful to learn more about a command. If it is a shell built in, it will not have a man page, instead, read about it using `man bash`.

```
❯ man source
No manual entry for source

❯ type source
source is a shell builtin
```

The `$PATH` variable contains a list of directories the system checks before running a command. Instead of running `/usr/bin/python3`, we can just run `python3` because `/usr/bin` is located in the path.

If you install a program that is not located in the `$PATH` variable, you can add it with either of the following two ways: 
```bash
export PATH=/the/file/path:$PATH $
#adds to the beginnning and will be checked first
#OR
export PATH=$PATH:/the/file/path
#adds to the end and will be checked last
```

##### Script Utilities
By default, `tee` will overwrite files, use `-a` to append: 
```
command | tee -a file
```
Tee can also be useful when writing to a protected file.
```
echo "newline" | sudo tee -a secret.txt
```
It is called "tee" as it resembles the letter "T" as well as the T-splitter in plumming since it takes from STDIN and "splits" or writes to both STDOUT and files. 

`egrep`, `fgrep` and `rgrep` are the  same  as  `grep -E`, `grep -F`, and `grep -r`.

`grep -F` is a fixed string, meaning you want the string to be passed verbatim, and not interpreted as special regex. Such as if the search includes a dot `user.txt` that you *don't* want to be interpreted as a regex wildcard.

`grep -E` is extended grep, which can be used for fancy expressions, like `()` for groups and `|` for OR. Here we search for any line that starts with "fork" or "group".
```
❯ grep -E '^no(fork|group)' /etc/group
nogroup:x:65534:
```
If you used regular grep without the -E, you'd have to escape out the special characters or else they'd be searched literally.
```
grep '^no\(fork\|group\)' /etc/group
```
As another useful example, we search for PCI devices starting with either "ethernet" or "network" with an insensitive search.
```
❯ lspci | egrep -i 'ethernet|network'
