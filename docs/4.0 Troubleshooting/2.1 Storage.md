#### I/O Schedulers
I/O Scheduling aka disk scheduling is how your computer handles read/write requests and in what order. Some emphasize particular goals, such as prioritizing certain processes I/O requests over others, to give a fair share of disk bandwidth to each process, or to ensure requests are complete by a particular deadline.

[Ubuntu Docs](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Reference/IOSchedulers)
"multiqueue is enabled by default providing the bfq, kyber, mq-deadline and none I/O schedulers"

 **mq-deadline (Multiqueue)**
This is an adaption of the deadline I/O scheduler but designed for Multiqueue devices. A good all-rounder with fairly low CPU overhead.

To check your scheduler 
```
❯ grep -i 'io scheduler' /var/log/dmesg
[    0.688085] kernel: io scheduler mq-deadline registered
# OR
❯ cat /sys/block/[Storage Device]/queue/scheduler 
[none] mq-deadline 
```
To change your scheduler to either three
```
❯ sudo echo [noop|cfq|deadline] > /sys/block/hda/queue/scheduler`
```

Three main ones are:
>- **CFQ (cfq):** the default scheduler for many Linux distributions; it places synchronous requests, submitted by processes, into a number of per-process queues and then allocates timeslices for each of the queues to access the disk.
>- **Noop scheduler (noop):** the simplest I/O scheduler for the Linux kernel based on the First In First Out (FIFO) queue concept. This scheduler is best suited for SSDs.
>- **Deadline scheduler (deadline):** attempts to guarantee a start service time for a request.
