Networking tools in Linux vary significantly across distributions.

The newer iproute2 package includes `ss` and `ip` which largely replace commands such as `ifconfig`, `route`, and `netstat`.

On the man page of the netstat command, you can read:
```
This program is mostly obsolete.  Replacement for netstat is ss. Replacement for  netstat -r  is ip route.  Replacement for netstat  i is ip -s link.  Replacement for netstat -g is ip maddr.
```

Like the man page says, the `ss` command has replaced the `netstat` command. Other deprecated programs in the net-tools package include:

`route` and `netstat -r` that have been replaced with `ip route`

`arp` which have been replaced by `ip neigh` or neighbor.

Some useful terminology to learn across these programs:

**inet** - internet protocol family (IPv4)
**inet6** - the modern protocol of IP addresses represented in hexidecimal
**lo** - virtual loop back device/interface for troubleshooting `ifconfig lo`
**wlo1** - wireless network interface (NIC)
**RX** - Receive
**TX** - Transmit

#### Network Monitoring
##### Tshark

`-i` for interface`-f` for capture filter
```
❯ sudo tshark -i wlo1 -f "src port 443"
```
You can also read `-r` from and write `-w` to a file.
##### tcpdump
Similar to tshark, `tcpdump` can also analyze packets on a network.

List interfaces with `-D`.
```
❯ tcpdump -D
1.wlo1 [Up, Running, Wireless, Associated]
2.any (Pseudo-device that captures on all interfaces) [Up, Running]
3.lo [Up, Running, Loopback]
4.enp2s0 [Up, Disconnected]
5.virbr0 [Up, Disconnected]
6.docker0 [Up, Disconnected]
```

The syntax is very similar to tshark
```
❯ sudo tcpdump -i wlo1 port 443 -w tcpdump.pcap
```



##### My Traceroute mtr
[Article](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/mtr-command) on `mtr` command. Combines `ping` and `traceroute` functionality.

`-r` report mode sends 10 packets in the background and write to sdout. Use `-c` to cycle the number of packets.

```
❯ mtr -r -c 15 google.com > report.txt
```

mtr uses ICMP echos by default, but you can use UDP with `-u` and TCP SYN packets with `-T`.

##### Checking Open Ports
You want set up a server for SSH, the first step is making sure port 22 is open. Here are the various ways to check.
```
nc -zv localhost 22
ss -tuln | grep ':22'
telnet localhost 22
sudo lsof -iTCP #look for a name with ssh
```

##### Firewalls
Let's say telnet refuses connection and the other commands do not find port 22, this could be UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is blocking it. UFW basically a wrapper over `iptables` for Ubuntu.
`sudo ufw status` will let you know if it is enabled or not, and what ports it allows or blocks.

UFW will either use `iptables` or `nftables` by default. Here we can see nf_tables is used, if it wasn't, it would say "legacy".
```
iptables -V
iptables v1.8.7 (nf_tables)
```
iptables is old and nftables if preferred.
